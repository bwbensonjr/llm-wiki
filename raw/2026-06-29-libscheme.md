## libscheme: Scheme as a C Library

## Abstract

Because of its small size and simplicity, Scheme is often seen as an ideal extension or scripting language. While there are many Scheme implementations available, their interfaces are often complex and can get in the way of using the implementation as part of a larger software product. The libscheme library makes the Scheme language available as a C library. Its interface is through a single C header file and it is easily extended with new primitive procedures, new primitive types, and new syntax. It is portable to any system that has an ANSI C compiler and to which Hans Boehm's popular conservative garbage collector [1] has been ported. It has been used to build a variety of special purpose data manipulation tools, and as an extension language for an ethernet monitor.

## 1 Introduction

There is a long tradition of scripting languages in the Unix community, the canonical example being /bin/sh [2]. Scripting languages allow the programmer to express programming ideas at a high level, and can also be designed in such a way that the language interpreter can be included as an extension language inside of other programs. When a program provides a powerful extension language to end users, it often increases the utility of the program by orders of magnitude (consider GNU Emacs and GNU Emacs Lisp as an example). While in recent years there has been an explosion of general purpose extension and scripting languages (e.g., Python [6] and Elk [4]), one language has had a dramatic increase in popularity and seems to have become the de facto extension language. That language is Tcl [5].

It is the author's opinion that the popularity of Tcl is primarily due to the ease with which it can be embedded into C applications (its interface is through a single C header file and a standard C library archive file) and the ease with which it can be extended with new primitive commands. The libscheme library attempts to learn from Tcl's success by making Scheme [3] available as a C library and by providing simple ways to extend the language with new procedures and syntax. While Scheme is not as convenient as Tcl in the role of an interactive shell program, it has several advantages over Tcl with respect to writing scripts:

1. Lexical Scope
2. Nested procedures
3. A richer set of data types
4. Extensible syntax

In addition, libscheme allows the application writer to extend the interpreter with new data types that have the same standing as built in types. It also provides a conservative garbage collector that can be used by application and extension writers.

## 2 Scheme

Scheme is a small, lexically scoped dialect of Lisp that is based on the principle that a programming language should not include everything but the kitchen sink, but rather it should provide a framework in which it is easy to build the kitchen sink.

Programming languages should be designed not by piling feature on top of feature, but by removing the weaknesses and restrictions that make additional features appear necessary. Scheme demonstrates that a very small number of rules for forming expressions, with no restrictions on how they are composed, suffice to form a practical and efficient programming language that is flexible enough to support most of the major programming paradigms in use today. [3]

These properties make Scheme a good general purpose programming language and also an ideal extension language. Its conceptual simplicity allows it to be implemented with a relatively small number of lines of code, while providing powerful high level programming constructs such as procedures that can be nested and used as first class values, and high-level data structures like lists, vectors and strings. It also removes the burden of memory management from the programmer, usually through some sort of garbage collector.

Scheme supports all major programming paradigms in use today including functional, procedural, and object oriented. It scales well from small applications to large software systems.

## 2.1 An Example Procedure

Let us examine a small Scheme procedure to get a feel for the language. The procedure in figure 1 splits a string of characters into a list of strings based on a delimiter character.

```scheme
(define (split-string string delimiter)
  (let ((len (string-length string)))

    ; Collect characters until we reach a delimiter character,
    ; at which time we extract a field and start looking for
    ; the next delimiter.
    ;
    (define (collect start end)
      (cond
       ((= end len)
        (list (substring string start end)))
       ((char=? (string-ref string end) delimiter)
        (cons (substring string start end)
              (collect (+ end 1) (+ end 1))))
       (else (collect start (+ end 1)))))

    ; Start at the beginning of the string.
    ;
    (collect 0 0)))
```

Figure 1: A sample Scheme function

In this example we have a top-level definition of the split-string function and an internal definition of the collect function. An internal, or nested function like collect has access to all lexical variables in the scope of its definition. More specifically, collect has access to the lexical variables string , delimiter and len . The let special form establishes a series of local variables and initial bindings. In split-string the let establishes only the binding of len . The cond special form evaluates the test in each of its clauses, performing the clauses action(s) when it finds the first test to succeed. The else clause of a cond form is executed if no other clause succeeds. Scheme also has other standard control constructs like if and case .

```scheme
> (split-string "brent:WgG6SfAUnX5lQ:5359:100:Brent Benson" #\:)
("brent" "WgG6SfAUnX5lQ" "5359" "100" "Brent Benson") >
```

## 2.2 Closures

Procedures are first class in Scheme, meaning that procedures can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other procedures, be returned from procedures, and be applied to arbitrary arguments. When they are created, procedures 'capture' variables that are free in their bodies. 1 Because of this 'closing over,' procedures are also known as closures in Scheme.

Closures can be used for a wide variety of purposes. They can be used to represent objects in an object-oriented framework, to model actors, to represent partially computed solutions, etc.

Unnamed procedures are created with the lambda special form. The existence of unnamed procedures frees the programmer from making up names for simple helper functions. For example, many Scheme implementations have a sort procedure that accepts a list or vector of elements, and a comparison procedure that is used to establish an ordering on the elements. It is often useful to use an unnamed procedure as the comparison function:

```scheme
> (sort '(1 6 3 4) (lambda (n1 n2) (< n1 n2)))
(1 3 4 6)
> (sort #("jim" "brent" "jason" "todd")
        (lambda (s1 s2) (string<? s1 s2)))
#("brent" "jason" "jim" "todd")
```

Note that (1 2 3 4) is a list of numbers and #("jim" ...) is a vector of strings.

The next example shows the definition of a procedure make-counter that returns another procedure created with lambda that closes over the count variable.

```scheme
> (define (make-counter)
    (let ((count 0))
      (lambda ()
        (set! count (+ count 1))
        count)))
make-counter
> (define c1 (make-counter))
c1
> (c1)
1
> (c1)
2
```

Since no one else has access to count it becomes private to the closure and can be modified and used within its context. In this particular case, count is incremented and its value returned when the procedure returned from make-counter is called.

## 2.3 Syntax

As you have probably already noticed, Scheme's syntax is Lisp-like. All function applications are in fully-parenthesized prefix form. While some find this sort of syntax unwieldy, it has the advantage that Scheme forms are actually lists which can be easily manipulated with standard list primitives. The libscheme library supports the defmacro special form that can be used by end users to create new special forms. A special form is a form that is evaluated by special rules. For example, the if special form only evaluates its 'then' condition if its test expression evaluates to true, otherwise it evalutes its 'else' expression.

1 A variable is free in a procedure if it is not contained in the parameter list.

These macros are much more powerful than the simple token-based substitution macros provided by languages like C.

## 3 An Application that Uses libdwarf

The libscheme library makes Scheme available as a C library. Its interface is through a single C header file. Scheme expressions can be read from an arbitrary input stream, evaluated with respect to a particular environment, and printed to an arbitrary output stream. The user can extend the interpreter by adding bindings to the global environment. Each binding can provide a new primitive written in C, a new syntax form, a new type, a constant, etc.

## 3.1 An Example

DWARF is a full-featured and complex debugging information format [7]. Our example program, dwarfscheme , is an interface that allows the user to browse DWARF information in an object file by providing stubs to the libdwarf [8] library. Figure 2 shows a sample dwarfscheme dialogue.

In this example the user invokes dwarfscheme , opens the file "a.out" for DWARF reading, defines a function for printing out debugging information entries (DIEs), and prints out the first DIE. This example shows how dwarfscheme would be used by an end user. Next, we will examine the way that the dwarfscheme executable was created using libscheme and the libdwarf libraries.

The program dwarfscheme is an executable that was produced by linking libscheme with a set of DWARF manipulating primitives, a read-eval-print loop that initializes the primitives, and the libdwarf library that is provided as a system library. The main routine for dwarfscheme appears in figure 3.

This main routine is a boiler-plate routine that is used when the application writer wants to make the application a Scheme read-eval-print loop. The thing that differentiates the main routines in different applications is the initializations that are done on the environment. In this case, we create a basic environment containing the standard libscheme bindings, and then add the DWARF specific bindings to it by calling init\_dwarf() . The rest of the routine takes care of the business of establishing an error handler, printing out a prompt, reading an expression, evaluating the expression, and printing out the result.

The application writer can also embed libscheme in an application that is not structured as a read-eval-print loop. For example, at program startup a windowing application might initialize a libscheme environment, read and evaluate Scheme expressions representing configuration information from a user configuration file, and then enter its event loop. The user might bring up a dialog box in which she can evaluate Scheme expressions to further configure and query the system's state.

The major part of the DWARF initialization routine, init\_dwarf() appears in figure 4. It consists of calls to scheme\_make\_type() to establish new data types, and then several calls to scheme\_add\_global() to add new global bindings to the environment provided as an argument. Each call to scheme\_add\_global() provides the Scheme name for the global, the initial value for the variable (in this case a new primitive that points to its C implementation), and an environment to which the global should be added. All routines and variables that are part of the dwarfscheme interface begin with a dw prefix, while routines and variables from the system-supplied libdwarf library begin with a dwarf prefix.

This practice of calling an initialization routine with the environment for each logical piece of code is only a convention, but is a helpful way of organizing libscheme code. The libscheme library itself is organized this way. Each file contains an initialization function that establishes that file's primitives.

```scheme
$ ./dwarfscheme
> (define dbg (dwarf-init &quot;a.out&quot;))
dbg
> (define die1 (dwarf-first-die dbg))
die1
> (define (dwarf-print-die die)
    (display (dwarf-tag-string (dwarf-tag die)))
    (newline)
    (for-each
      (lambda (attr)
        (display &quot;  &quot;)
        (display (dwarf-attr-name-string (dwarf-attr-name attr)))
        (display &quot; &quot;)
        (write (dwarf-attr-value attr))
        (newline))
      (dwarf-attributes die)))

Figure 2: dwarfscheme dialogue

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "scheme.h"
#include "dwarfscheme.h"

main()
{
  Scheme_Env *env;
  Scheme_Object *obj;

  env = scheme_basic_env ();
  init_dwarf (env);
  scheme_default_handler ();
  do
    {
      printf ("> ");
      obj = scheme_read (stdin);
      if (obj == scheme_eof)
        {
          printf ("\n; done\n");
          exit (0);
        }
      obj = scheme_eval (obj, env);
      scheme_write (stdout, obj);
      printf ("\n");
    }
  while ( 1 );
}
```

Figure 4: The DWARF primitive initialization routine

A sample primitive is shown in figure 5. Each libscheme primitive accepts an argument count and a vector of evaluated arguments. Each primitive procedure is responsible for checking the number and type of its arguments. All Scheme objects are represented by the C type Scheme\_Object (see section 4.1). The types Dwarf\_Debug and Dwarf\_Die are foreign to libscheme and are provided by the libdwarf library.

```c
static Scheme_Object *dw_debug_type;
static Scheme_Object *dw_die_type;
static Scheme_Object *dw_first_die (int argc, Scheme_Object *argv[]);
...
void
init_dw (Scheme_Env *env)
{
  dw_debug_type = scheme_make_type ("<debug>");
  dw_die_type = scheme_make_type ("<die>");
  dw_attribute_type = scheme_make_type ("<attribute>");
  scheme_add_global ("dwarf-init",
                     scheme_make_prim (dw_init), env);
  scheme_add_global ("dwarf-first-die",
                     scheme_make_prim (dw_first_die), env);
  scheme_add_global ("dwarf-next-die",
                     scheme_make_prim (dw_next_die), env);
  scheme_add_global ("dwarf-tag",
                     scheme_make_prim (dw_tag), env);
  ...
}
```

Figure 5: A dwarfscheme primitive

The SCHEME\_ASSERT() macro asserts that a particular form evaluates to true, and signals an error otherwise. The dw\_first\_die() routine first checks for the correct number of arguments, then it checks that the first argument is an object with type dw\_debug\_type . Next, it extracts the pointer value representing the DWARF information in the file from the first argument, a Scheme\_Object . It then calls a libdwarf function, dwarf\_nextdie() and returns an appropriate value-a new dw\_die\_type object if there is another DIE, the Scheme false value otherwise. The dw\_make\_die() routine accepts a Dwarf\_Die as an argument and returns a libscheme object of type dw\_die\_type that contains a pointer to the Dwarf\_Die structure.

Now that we have a feel for the way that libscheme is extended, we will take a closer look at the design of libscheme itself.

## 4 libscheme Architecture

This section describes some specifics of libscheme 's implementation. An important feature of its design is that beyond a small kernel of routines for memory management, error handling, and evaluation, all of its Scheme primitives are implemented in the same way as nonlibscheme extensions. This is similar to Tcl's implementation strategy.

## 4.1 Object Representation

Every object in libscheme is an instance of the C structure Scheme\_Object . Each instance of Scheme\_Object contains a pointer to a type object (that also happens to be a Scheme\_Object )

and two data words. If an object requires more than two words of storage or if the object is some other type of foreign C structure, it is stored in a separate memory location and pointed to by the ptr\_val fi eld. The actual definition of Scheme\_Object appears in figure 6.

```c
static Scheme_Object *
dw_first_die (int argc, Scheme_Object *argv[])
{
  Dwarf_Debug dbg;
  Dwarf_Die die;

  SCHEME_ASSERT ((argc == 1),
                 "dwarf-first-die: wrong number of args");
  SCHEME_ASSERT (DWARF_DEBUGP (argv[0]),
                 "dwarf-first-die: arg must be a debug object");
  dbg = (Dwarf_Debug) SCHEME_PTR_VAL (argv[0]);
  die = dwarf_nextdie (dbg, NULL, NULL);
  if (! die)
    {
      return (scheme_false);
    }
  else
    {
      return (dw_make_die (die));
    }
}
```

Figure 6: The definition of Scheme Object

While many Scheme implementations choose to represent certain special objects as immediate values (e.g., small integers, characters, the empty list, etc.) this approach was not used in libscheme because the 'everything is an object with a tag approach' is simpler and easier to debug. A side effect of this decision is that libscheme code that does heavy small integer arithmetic will allocate garbage that must be collected, in contrast to higher performance Scheme implementations that only dynamically allocate very large integers.

## 4.2 Primitive Functions

Primitive functions in Scheme are implemented as C functions that take two arguments, an argument count and a vector of Scheme\_Object s. Each primitive is responsible for checking for the correct number of arguments-allowing maximum flexibility for procedures of variable arity-and for checking the types of its arguments. All arguments to a primitive function are evaluated before they are passed to the primitive, following Scheme semantics. If the application writer wants to create a primitive that doesn't evaluate its arguments, she must use a syntax primitive. C functions are turned into libscheme primitives with the scheme\_make\_prim() function that accepts the C function as an argument and returns a new Scheme object of type scheme\_prim\_type .

## 4.3 Primitive Syntax

The user can add new primitive syntax and special forms to libscheme . A libscheme syntax form is implemented as a C function that takes two arguments, an expression and an environment in which the expression should be evaluated. The form is passed directly to the syntax form with no evaluation performed. This allows the syntax primitive itself to evaluate parts of the form as needed. Figure 7 shows the implementation of the if special form. Note that if cannot be implemented as a procedure because it must not evaluate all of its arguments. The scheme\_eval() function evaluates a libscheme expression with respect to a particular environment.

```c
struct Scheme_Object
{
  struct Scheme_Object *type;
  union
    {
      char char_val;
      int int_val;
      double double_val;
      char *string_val;
      void *ptr_val;
      struct Scheme_Object *(*prim_val)
        (int argc, struct Scheme_Object *argv[]);
      struct Scheme_Object *(*syntax_val)
        (struct Scheme_Object *form, struct Scheme_Env *env);
      struct { struct Scheme_Object *car, *cdr; } pair_val;
      struct { int size; struct Scheme_Object **els; }
               vector_val;
      struct { struct Scheme_Env *env;
               struct Scheme_Object *code; } closure_val;
    } u;
};
```

Figure 7: The if special form

C functions that represent syntax forms are turned into Scheme objects by passing them to the scheme\_make\_syntax() procedure which returns a new object of type scheme\_syntax\_type .

## 4.4 Type Extensions

Scheme as defined in its standard has the following data types: boolean, list, symbol, number, character, string, vector, and procedure. While Scheme in its current form does not allow the creation of user-defined types, the libscheme system allows users to extend the type system with new types by calling the scheme\_make\_type() function with a string representing the name of the new type. This function returns a type object that can be used as a type tag in subsequently created objects. Normally, types are created in a file's initialization function and objects of the new type are created using a user-defined constructor function that allocates and initializes instances of the type.

In figure 8 we see the constructor for the dw\_debug\_type type from our dwarfscheme example. It accepts an object of type Dwarf\_Debug , a pointer to a C structure defined in the libdwarf library, allocates a new Scheme\_Object , sets the object type, and stores the pointer to the foreign structure into the ptr\_val slot of the object.

```c
static Scheme_Object *
if_syntax (Scheme_Object *form, Scheme_Env *env)
{
  int len;
  Scheme_Object *test, *thenp, *elsep;

  len = scheme_list_length (form);
  SCHEME_ASSERT (((len == 3) || (len == 4)),
                 "badly formed if statement");
  test = SCHEME_SECOND (form));
  test = scheme_eval (test, env);
  if (test != scheme_false)
    {
      thenp = SCHEME_THIRD (form);
      return (scheme_eval (thenp, env));
    }
  else
    {
      if (len == 4)
        {
          elsep = SCHEME_FOURTH (form);
          return (scheme_eval (elsep, env));
        }
      else
        {
          return (scheme_false);
        }
    }
}
```

Figure 8: An object constructor

It is often convenient to define a macro that checks whether a libscheme object is of a specified type. The macro defined in dwarfscheme for the DWARF debug object looks like this:

```c
#define DW_DEBUGP(obj) (SCHEME_TYPE(obj) == dwarf_debug_type)
```

The 'P' at the end of DW\_DEBUGP indicates that the macro is a predicate that returns a true or false value. All of the builtin types have type predicate macros of this form (e.g., SCHEME\_PAIRP , SCHEME\_VECTORP , etc.).

## 4.5 Environment Representation

The state of the interpreter is contained in an object of type Scheme\_Env . The environment contains both global and local bindings. The definition of the Scheme\_Env structure is shown in figure 9. The global variable bindings are held in a hash table. The local bindings are represented by a vector of variables (symbols) and a vector of corresponding values. An environment that holds local variables points to the enclosing environment with its next fi eld. Therefore, variable value lookup consists of walking the environment chain, looking for a local variable of the correct name. If no local binding is found, the variable is looked for in the global hash table.

```c
struct Scheme_Env
{
  int num_bindings;
  struct Scheme_Object **symbols;
  struct Scheme_Object **values;
  Scheme_Hash_Table *globals;
  struct Scheme_Env *next;
};
```

Figure 9: The Scheme Env structure

Table 1 lists the environment manipulation functions. Unless the user is adding special forms that create variable bindings, she usually only needs to worry about the scheme\_basic\_env() and scheme\_add\_global() functions. The scheme\_basic\_env() function is used to create a new environment with the standard Scheme bindings which can then be extended with new primitives, types, etc. using scheme\_add\_global() .

## 4.6 Interpreter Interface

The libscheme functions that are used for reading, evaluating and writing expressions are listed in table 2.

| &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| --- | --- |
| `scheme_basic_env ()`                 | Return a new `libscheme` env |
| `scheme_add_global (name, val, env)`  | Add a new global binding |
| `scheme_add_frame (syms, vals, env)`  | Add a frame of local bindings |
| `scheme_pop_frame (env)`              | Pop a local frame |
| `scheme_lookup_value (sym, env)`      | Lookup the value of a variable |
| `scheme_lookup_global (sym, env)`     | Lookup the value of a global |
| `scheme_set_value (sym, val, env)`    | Set the value of a variable |

Table 1: Environment manipulation functions

| &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
| --- | --- |
|  `scheme_read (fp)`          | Read an expression from stream |
|  `scheme_eval (obj, env)`    | Evaluate an object in environment |
|  `scheme_write (fp, obj)`    | Write object in machine readable form |
|  `scheme_display (fp, obj)`  | Write object in human readable form |

Table 2: Interpreter functions

These functions can be used in the context of a read-eval-print loop or called at arbitrary times during program execution.

## 4.7 Error Handling

The libscheme library provides rudimentary error handling support. Errors are signaled using the scheme\_signal\_error() function, or by failing the assertion in a SCHEME\_ASSERT() expression. If the default error handler is installed by calling scheme\_default\_handler() , then all uncaught errors will print the error message and abort() . Errors can be caught by evaluating an expression within a SCHEME\_CATCH\_ERROR() form. This macro evaluates its first argument. If an error occurs during the execution, the value second argument is returned, otherwise, the value of the first expression is returned.

```c
obj = scheme_read (stdin);
result = SCHEME_CATCH_ERROR (scheme_eval (obj, env), 0);
if (result == 0)
 {
   /* error handling code */
 }
else
 {
   scheme_write (stdout, result);
 }
```

## 4.8 Memory Allocation/Garbage Collection

The libscheme library uses Hans Boehm and Alan Demers' conservative garbage collector [1]. It provides a replacement for the C library function malloc() called GC\_malloc() . The storage that is allocated by GC\_malloc() is subject to garbage collection. The collector uses a conservative approach, meaning that when it scans for accessible objects it treats anything that could possibly point into the garbage collected heap as an accessible pointer. Therefore, it is possible that an integer or a floating point number that looks like a pointer into this area could be treated as a root and the storage that it points to would not be collected. In practice, this rarely happens.

Users of libscheme can use the garbage collector in their own program and are strongly encouraged to make use of it when extending libscheme . Normally the user can simply call scheme\_alloc\_object() to allocate a new Scheme\_Object , but occasionally other types of objects need to be allocated dynamically.

The Boehm/Demers collector is freely available and can run on most any 32-bit Unix machine.

## 5 Pros, Cons and Future Work

The libscheme library is simple to understand and use. It builds on the powerful semantic base of the Scheme programming language. The library also provides several powerful extensions to Scheme including an extensible type system and user defined structure types.

The libscheme interpreter is not very fast. The primary reason is an inefficient function calling sequence that dynamically allocates storage, creating unnecessary garbage. This issue is being addressed and future versions should be a great deal more efficient. In any case, libscheme is intended primarily for interactive and scripting use for which its performance is already adequate.

When compared to a language like Tcl, Scheme is not as well suited for interactive command processing. A possible solution is to add a syntax veneer on top of the parenthetical Scheme syntax for interactive use. On the other hand, Scheme's clean and powerful semantics provide a sizeable advantage over Tcl for writing large pieces of software. It also has the advantage of real data types rather than Tcl's lowest common denominator 'everything is a string' approach.

The libscheme library has already been used in many small projects. The author plans to make libscheme even more useful by providing a variety of useful bindings including interfaces to the POSIX system calls, a socket library, a regular expression package, etc.

## 6 Conclusion

The libscheme library makes Scheme available as a standard C library and is easily extended with new primitives, types, and syntax. It runs on most Unix workstations including Harris Nighthawks, Suns, Intel 386/486 under Linux and OS/2, HP9000s, DECstations and DEC Alphas running OSF/1, IBM RS/6000s, NeXT machines and many others. Its simplicity and extensibility lends itself to use as an extension or scripting language for large systems. Currently it is being used by the DNPAP team at Delf University of Technology in the Netherlands as part of their ethernet monitor, and is being evaluated for use in a variety of other projects. The latest version of libscheme can be obtained from the Scheme Repository, ftp.cs.indiana.edu , in the directory /pub/imp/ .
